Details
========================================================

Challenge participants were asked to complete a quiz to describe some of the
details about their entry:


#### Is your method probabilistic?

probabilistic


#### How do you perform inference?

sampling


#### What sort of prior do you put on the parameters of your model?

none


#### Do you cluster CNAs? SNVs? SVs? Indels? (Check all that apply)

snv


#### If you use CNAs in your inference do you use clonal CNAs only or do you also use subclonal CNAs?

none


#### If you use CNAs, do you use total CN only or do you use allele specific copy numbers?

none


#### Do you correct for cancer cell fraction?

no


#### Do you predict mutation multiplicities?

no


#### Do you cluster all mutations at once or do you do post hoc assignment?

no


#### How do you choose the number of clusters?

nonparametric


#### Do you assume "weak parsimony" (i.e. that mutations in the same cluster are in the same cell)?

no


#### Do you attempt to infer the phylogeny of the tumour?

yes


#### Does your method make any of these assumptions? (Check those that apply)

infinite_sites


#### What noise model do you use for Variant Allele Fractions?

other


#### Is the source code for your method available?  If yes, please provide a link to where the code is available.

yes


#### What is the peer-reviewed publishing status of your method?  If it has been published please provide a DOI or PMID.

published


#### Has a description of your method appeared in a non-peer-reviewed format?  If yes, please provide a link.

no
